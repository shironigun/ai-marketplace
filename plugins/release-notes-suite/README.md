# release-notes-suite

A two-stage pipeline for turning what engineering shipped into dealer-facing release notes for **TargetCRM / Notify360** (ConstellationDealer).

```
harvester  ->  releaser  ->  Notify360 note + TargetCRM note
(gather all)   (suppress + write)     (brand variants)
```

## Skills

- **harvester** — builds the *complete* engineering release inventory for a date window or an initiative (e.g. "DIS Two-Way Sync"). Pulls User Stories, Bugs and Defects across **both** the CRM Team and Target SWAT boards, plus the git layer (merged PRs / commits / deployments), and deliberately catches work that shipped with **no linked ticket**. Output is the internal, exhaustive, grouped inventory — the raw material for notes. This is the opposite discipline to `releaser`: completeness, not curation.
- **releaser** — turns an inventory or a technical draft into the short, benefit-led dealer note in Ben Schmidt / support-team house style, deciding what to announce vs. suppress. Emits **Notify360** (DIS-facing brand) and **TargetCRM** variants from one run; branding is a profile, not a separate skill.

## Install note

If you already have the standalone `releaser` skill installed, remove it after installing this suite so you don't run two copies. The suite's `releaser` is the maintained version (adds brand variants).
