# Comment templates (Mahmood's voice)

Post by writing the HTML to `System.History` via `update_work_item`. Always get approval first. Replace `GUID` with the person's identity GUID (from the work item's AssignedTo/CreatedBy or `get_me`); fall back to plain `@Name` text if unknown.

Mention anchor:
```html
<a href="#" data-vss-mention="version:2.0,GUID">@Name</a>
```

## 1. Status / verification (closing the loop)

```html
<div><b>Status:</b> Tested and resolved. The fix is verified through QA testing on <ENV>.</div>
<div><b>CC:</b> <a href="#" data-vss-mention="version:2.0,GUID">@Dev Owner</a> <a href="#" data-vss-mention="version:2.0,GUID">@Stakeholder</a></div>
```

## 2. Root-cause analysis (RCA)

```html
<div><b>Bug Details:</b> This bug has been inspected. The issue happened because <one-line cause naming the exact config key / dealer ID / error code>.</div>
<div><ul>
  <li>Due to this, <consequence, e.g. the token issuer changed and TargetCRM got a 401 Unauthorized error>.</li>
  <li>We have now <corrective action>, redeployed, and verified the fix through QA testing.</li>
</ul></div>
<div><b>Status:</b> Tested and resolved.</div>
<div><b>CC:</b> @… @…</div>
```

## 3. Finding / investigation (production / auth / API)

```html
<div><b>FINDINGS</b></div>
<ol>
  <li><finding 1 — what works, with attachment ref></li>
  <li><finding 2 — what fails></li>
  <li><finding 3 — open question / who to check with></li>
</ol>
<div>Payload / response for reference:</div>
<div><pre><JSON or error body></pre></div>
<div>@… @…</div>
```

## 4. Hand-off / needs-info

```html
<div><a href="#" data-vss-mention="version:2.0,GUID">@Dev Owner</a> please check <specific area>. Repro on <dealer ID / env>; <error code> observed. Credentials are in the System Info section.</div>
```

## 5. Cross-team escalation (Everest / Ideal feeds, IDMS/SSO)

Process-escalation tone — state ownership and the approved path:
```html
<div><a href="#" data-vss-mention="version:2.0,GUID">@Owner</a> Ideal can only help sync between Ideal and Everest as far as IDMS is concerned. If there is any issue with feeds, please involve the Everest team and have them contact us — that's the approved process. Unless it's the Customer Feed (TCRM → Ideal) or the TCRM embedded browser in Ideal, submit that issue to <a href="#" data-vss-mention="version:2.0,GUID">@Owner</a>.</div>
<div>@… @… @…</div>
```

## Voice checklist

- Bold labels (`Bug Details:`, `Status:`, `FINDINGS`, `CC:`).
- Root cause as bullets/numbered list, not prose.
- Name exact config keys, URLs, dealer IDs, branch names, error codes.
- Verification language: "verified the fix through QA testing", "Tested and resolved."
- CC the dev owner + cross-team stakeholders at the end.
- No emojis, no greetings, no sign-offs.
